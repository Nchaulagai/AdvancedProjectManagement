Project Lookout: Vehicle Recovery Platform
Overview: Project Lookout is a centralized app designed to combat vehicle theft, inspired by Project FADA-RI's secure vehicle identification system. Developed in collaboration with the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC), the app enables users to report and locate missing vehicles, utilizing technologies like optical character recognition (OCR) for vehicle identification from images.

Problem Statement: With over 810,000 vehicles stolen worldwide in 2021 (Bankrate, 2022), traditional methods like social media posts or police reports are often ineffective. Thereâ€™s no dedicated platform for the swift recovery of stolen vehicles, especially in regions without proper tracking systems.

Solution: Lookout offers users a streamlined platform to report missing vehicles and search for them. The app leverages OCR to recognize number plates from uploaded images, even if they are blurry. It also allows users to collaborate with law enforcement and uses GPS notifications to suggest safer routes in high-theft areas.

Business Model:

Reward System: Users post rewards for locating their stolen vehicles, with Lookout taking a small commission.
Post Boosting: Urgent cases can pay to promote posts for greater visibility.
Proxy Advertisements: Lookout runs paid ad campaigns for missing vehicles on social media.
Sponsorships/Donations: Funding from local authorities, charitable organizations, and users.
Development & Features:

Built using Flutter with technical support from GDSC.
OCR: Automated recognition of vehicle number plates.
Law Enforcement Integration: Direct reporting and collaboration with authorities.
GPS Notifications: Alerts for high-theft areas and safer route suggestions.
Data Security: Encryption and two-factor authentication protect user data.
Challenges & Risks: Potential risks include limited user adoption and legal challenges accessing law enforcement databases. To mitigate these, Lookout employs OCR for accurate identification and encryption to secure data.

Project Timeline & Budget: Development and testing are expected to take one year, with a budget of 10,000 Euros, covering testing, law enforcement integration, user rewards, and marketing.

Conclusion: Lookout is a tech-driven solution addressing vehicle theft, combining community reporting, OCR, and law enforcement collaboration. It showcases my technical and problem-solving skills in tackling real-world issues through innovative solutions.
